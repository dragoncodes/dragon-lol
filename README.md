# Motivation

## Personal

Due to the fact that I work in a Freelancing company I always sign an NDA and never have projects to show for my portfolio. This project although lacking 
in design shows rendering remotely fetched data and displaying useful statistics.

## Community

Over the course of the next few months this project will expand and show more and more statistics for my fellow League players to use and obtain more game knowledge.

Currently the support for other people is very limited only Europe West is supported and to check your own statistics you must go to

# Running the code
I have a custom Back-End for this project in order to hide my Riot API key as per Riot's suggestions - this is only the Front-End.
 
`git clone https://github.com/dragoncodes/dragon-lol.git ./reactive-league`
`npm install`
`npm start`
